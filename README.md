## Welcome to my website!

Hello! I am Orla and I am a seventeen year old student from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying in Dominican College. In this website I will explain the basis course content of the subjects I am currently studying at A-Level, including coursework. I hope this information will be useful to anyone wishing to study any of these subjects through further education and gives them an honest insight from a student's point of view.

The board all four of my subjects are with is [CCEA](http://ccea.org.uk).
