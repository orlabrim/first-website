## Welcome to my website!

Hello! I am Orla and I am a seventeen year old student from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying in Dominican College. In this website I will explain the basis course content of the subjects I am currently studying at A-Level, including coursework. I hope this information will be useful to anyone wishing to study any of these subjects through further education and gives them an honest insight from a student's point of view.

### English Literature

Studying English Literature at A-Level is no easy task. The level of work involved is intense, but it is massively rewarding. The course is split in to two sections:

1. AS - Study of Prose (Wuthering Heights), Drama (A Streetcar Named Desire) and Poetry (Seamus Heaney and Robert Frost).
2. A2 - Study of Prose, Drama and Poetry.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/orlabrim/first-website/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
