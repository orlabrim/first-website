## Welcome to my website!

Hello! I am Orla and I am a seventeen year old student from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying in Dominican College. In this website I will explain the basis course content of the subjects I am currently studying at A-Level, including coursework. I hope this information will be useful to anyone wishing to study any of these subjects through further education and gives them an honest insight from a student's point of view.

The board all four of my subjects are with is [CCEA](http://ccea.org.uk).

### English Literature

Studying English Literature at A-Level is no easy task. The level of work involved is intense, but it is massively rewarding. The course is split in to two sections:

AS | A2
------------ | -------------
Study of Prose Pre 1900 (Wuthering Heights) | Shakespearean Genres
Study of Drama 1900–Present (A Streetcar Named Desire) | Internal Assessment
Study of Poetry 1900–Present (Heaney and Frost) | The Study of Poetry Pre 1900 and Unseen Poetry
                                          
### Moving Image Arts

Within studying Moving Image Arts at A-Level, you learn about the background of cinema, the techniques of the five areas of film and how to put these techniques in to practise.

For our coursework we had to submit
1. A Statement of Intentions (Including a synopsis and evaluation)
2. A Director's Notebook
3. Pre-production materials (including a storyboard, shot list and script)
4. A 3-4 minute film.

#### Statement of Intentions

Within a statement of intentions, you have to describe 

Part | Content
------------ | -------------
Synopsis | What is your film going to be about? It should be a short description, summarising the beginning, middle and end of your film.
Intentions | This includes where your idea came from, (e.g. from music videos, artworks or films you have previously seen). It details how you will implement the five areas of film language (sound, lighting, camera technique, mise-en-scene and editing) in to your film idea.
Evaluation | This details what you feel went right in the production of the film and where you felt could have gone better. It also includes what did not go to plan, and how, as a director, you overcame this.

For my statement of intentions, I took a majority of my influences from Hitchock's collections of movies. His Film Noir classic [Citizen Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane) included an array of camera and lighting techniques I wished to include in my film.
