## Welcome to my website!

Hello! I am Orla and I am a seventeen year old student from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying in Dominican College. In this website I will explain the basis course content of the subjects I am currently studying at A-Level, including coursework. I hope this information will be useful to anyone wishing to study any of these subjects through further education and gives them an honest insight from a student's point of view.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/orlabrim/first-website/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/orlabrim/first-website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
