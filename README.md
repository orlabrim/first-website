## Welcome to my website!

Hello! I am Orla and I am a seventeen year old student from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying in Dominican College. In this website I will explain the basis course content of the subjects I am currently studying at A-Level, including coursework. I hope this information will be useful to anyone wishing to study any of these subjects through further education and gives them an honest insight from a student's point of view.

The board all four of my subjects are with is [CCEA](http://ccea.org.uk).

### English Literature

Studying English Literature at A-Level is no easy task. The level of work involved is intense, but it is massively rewarding. The course is split in to two sections:

AS | A2
------------ | -------------
Study of Prose Pre 1900 (Wuthering Heights) | Shakespearean Genres
Study of Drama 1900–Present (A Streetcar Named Desire) | Internal Assessment
Study of Poetry 1900–Present (Heaney and Frost) | The Study of Poetry Pre 1900 and Unseen Poetry


### Wuthering Heights

*Wuthering Heights* is a gothic tale about how an orphaned boy named **Heathcliff** is taken in by a man to live with his family in **Wuthering Heights**, on the edge of civilisation. It entails the supernatural, a romantic intesrest and an elaborate revenge plot that ruins the lives of many.

#### Emily Bronte

Life at the time Bronte wrote this novel would have been difficult 
for a number of reasons:
* Expectations for women were to simply become the woman of the 
house and conform to the expected standards of femininity.
* Diseases were common and fatal, therefore death was not uncommon.
* Harsh weather conditions.
