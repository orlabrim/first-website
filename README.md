## Welcome to my website!

Hello! I am Orla and I am a seventeen year old student from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying in Dominican College. In this website I will explain the basis course content of the subjects I am currently studying at A-Level, including coursework. I hope this information will be useful to anyone wishing to study any of these subjects through further education and gives them an honest insight from a student's point of view.

The board all four of my subjects are with is CCEA.

### English Literature

Studying English Literature at A-Level is no easy task. The level of work involved is intense, but it is massively rewarding. The course is split in to two sections:

1. AS - Study of Prose (Wuthering Heights), Drama (A Streetcar Named Desire) and Poetry (Seamus Heaney and Robert Frost).
2. A2 - Study of Prose, Drama and Poetry.

### Wuthering Heights

Within studying this novel, you learn about
1. The conext in which Bronte wrote the novel, including the family's living conditions, social expectations for women at the time and how she defied the usual romance story for the more gruesome and gothic tale of a deranged family.
